        <h1> Demonstration of Float Position</h1>
        <p id="col1">The float CSS property specifies that an 
             element should be placed along the left or right side of its container, 
             allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from 
             the normal flow of the web page, though still remaining a part of the flow 
             (in contrast to absolute positioning).</p>
        <p id="col2">Float values are the precise wear value of a skin.
             This value is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the least wear.
             The float values are mostly used in trading and trade-ups, 
             and for most people the exterior quality is enough to know.</p>
        <p id="col3">  When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float:
             If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. 
             Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will
             appear below it on the web page.</p>
